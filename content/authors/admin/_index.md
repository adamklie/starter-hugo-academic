# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My name is Adam Klie and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in the Bioinformatics and Systemâ€™s Biology (BISB) program. I am advised by Dr. Hannah Carter and I am currently working to understand gene regulatory dysregulation in the context of cancer. To do so, I look to apply and improve machine learning methods for genetic variant and gene regulatory network analysis.
